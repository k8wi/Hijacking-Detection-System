# Hijacking-Detection-System

This project called a HIJACKING DETECTION SYSTEM using Arduino UNO which contains weapon detection, face detection, an automatic door locking system, and a Tranquilizer gun that will neutralize a potential hijacker.

This project aims to develop a weapon detection system using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The system will be trained on a dataset of images and videos of weapons and non-weapons. Once trained, the system will be able to automatically detect weapons in new images and videos.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of a set of images contaning a weapon and a set of images that don't.

Cascade trainer GUI is used to train the dataset of positive and negative images:
positive images: images with weapon
negative images: images without weapons
